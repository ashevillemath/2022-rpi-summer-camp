# Electronics notes

Based on the first few lessons of [this course on Engineering Circuits on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnVYEpTNGNtUSjEEYf01D-q4ExTO960sG).

## Lesson 1 - Voltage, Current, Resistance

### Current

**Circuit** - Closed loop that carries electricity.

**Electron (Electric) Current** - Flow of electrons in a circuit. Flow of negative charge. Flow of electricity.


**Hole current ($i$)** - Opposite of electric current. Positive current flow. Flow of positive charge.

**Ampere (Amp or A)** = Units of current. The higher the Amps, the higher the current. How many charges per second. Doesn't take many amps to kill a person.

Analogy of electric current is the current in a stream.

Source (battery) always has a positive and negative terminal.

### Voltage

**Voltage** - The "push" that causes the current to flow. The source. The current and voltage are closely related. You can not have any current flowing without something pushing it.

**Volts (V)** - Units of voltage. The more volts there are, the more potential there is to move current through a circuit.

### Resistance

**Resistance** - Opposes current flow in a circuit.

The smaller the wire, the more the resistance.

**Ohm ($\Omega$)** - Units of resistance.

### You can use metric prefixes:
* A, mA, $\mu$A, etc
* $\Omega$, m$\Omega$, $\mu\Omega$, k$\Omega$, M$\Omega$ etc
* V, mV, kV, MV, etc

### DC and AC
**DC (Direct Current)** - Constant current flow. Constant voltage and current. Batteries are DC.

**AC (Alternating Current)** - Current moves back and forth. Wall socket. In US, 60 Hz, 60 times a second.

Why do we have AC? It's much easier to generate AC and transmit it to homes.

### Open circuit and Short circuit
**Open circuit** - an electrical circuit that is not complete. Can be on purpose, like a wall switch.

**Short circuit** - An electrical circuit that allows a current to go through an unintended path. Can lead to heat, smoke, and fire.

## Lesson 2 - Overview of Circuit Components - Resistor, Capacitor, Inductor, Transistor, Diode, Transformer

**Source Voltage, or Battery etc** 

Base unit = volts

**Resistor** - Resists electric current. Can use these to control the amount of current in different legs of the circuit.

Base unit = Ohm

**Capacitor** - Device that stores energy in an electric field.

Base unit = Farad (F), usually you see $\mu$F

**Inductor** - Device that stores energy in a magnetic field.

Base unit = Henry (H)

**Diode** - Only allows the electric current to flow in one direction.

**LED (Light Emitting Diode)**

**Transistor** - Transistors have two functions. It can act as an electronic switch. It can also act as an amplifier.

**Transformer** - Allow a voltage to be increased or decreased to another voltage inside of a circuit.

## Lesson 3 - Ohm's Law in Circuit Analysis
A relation between current, voltage, and resistance.

### Ohm's Law
Use Ohm's Law with Volts, Ohms, and Amps.
$$V = IR$$

$$Voltage = Current \times Resistance$$

$$I = \frac{V}{R}$$

If we increase the voltage, the current increases. If we increase the resistance, the current decreases.

Example. Battery with 10V and resistor with 5 $\Omega$. The voltage drop across the resistor is 10V. 

$$i = 10 \div 5 = 2$$

Current equals voltage drop across resistor divided by resistance.

Passive component does not supply power. An active component does.

When referring to voltage, we are always referring to a voltage drop across a component in the circuit.

Voltage is like potential energy.
