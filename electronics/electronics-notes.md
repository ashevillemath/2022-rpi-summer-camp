# Electronics notes

## Lesson 1 - Voltage, Current, Resistance

**Circuit** - Closed loop that carries electricity.

**Electron (Electric) Current** - Flow of electrons in a circuit. Flow of negative charge.


**Hole current ($i$)** - Opposite of electric current. Positive current flow. Flow of positive charge.

**Ampere (Amp or A)** = Units of current. The higher the Amps, the higher the current. How many charges per second. Doesn't take many amps to kill a person.

Analogy of electric current is the current in a stream.

Source (battery) always has a positive and negative terminal.

**Voltage** - The "push" that causes the current to flow. The source. The current and voltage are closely related. You can not have any current flowing without something pushing it.

**Volts (V)** - Units of voltage. The more volts there are, the more potential there is to move current through a circuit.
